# Password_Manager
This is an easy-to-use password manager written in Java for a school project. 
It is based on the system of using only one master key to access many passwords which the manager can store.
It encrypts passwords in several ways and stores them locally on your system.

There are two starting points of the application:
1. "MainGUI.java" -> used to start the GUI version of the password manager.
2. "Manager.java" -> used to run the CLI version of the password manager.
